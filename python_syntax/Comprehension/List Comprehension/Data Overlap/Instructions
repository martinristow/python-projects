Data Overlap
💪 This exercise is HARD 💪

Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

e.g. if file1.txt contained:

1

2

3

and file2.txt contained:

2

3

4

result = [2, 3]



IMPORTANT:  The output should be a list of integers and not strings!

Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
