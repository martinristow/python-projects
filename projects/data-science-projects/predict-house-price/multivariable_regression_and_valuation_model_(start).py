# Setup and Context

### Introduction

Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:
* The number of rooms
* The distance to employment centres
* How rich or poor the area is
* How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/WfUSSP7.png height=350>

To accomplish your task you will:

1. Analyse and explore the Boston house price data
2. Split your data for training and testing
3. Run a Multivariable Regression
4. Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals
5. Use data transformation to improve your model performance
6. Use your model to estimate a property price

# Understand the Relationships in the Data

### Run a Pair Plot

**Challenge**

There might be some relationships in the data that we should know about. Before you run the code, make some predictions:

* What would you expect the relationship to be between pollution (NOX) and the distance to employment (DIS)?
* What kind of relationship do you expect between the number of rooms (RM) and the home value (PRICE)?
* What about the amount of poverty in an area (LSTAT) and home prices?

Run a [Seaborn `.pairplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html?highlight=pairplot#seaborn.pairplot) to visualise all the relationships at the same time. Note, this is a big task and can take 1-2 minutes! After it's finished check your intuition regarding the questions above on the `pairplot`.

* DIS and NOX

* LSTAT vs RM
* LSTAT vs PRICE
* RM vs PRICE

Try adding some opacity or `alpha` to the scatter plots using keyword arguments under `joint_kws`.

We *can't* use all 506 entries in our dataset to train our model. The reason is that we want to evaluate our model on data that it hasn't seen yet (i.e., out-of-sample data). That way we can get a better idea of its performance in the real world.

**Challenge**

* Import the [`train_test_split()` function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) from sklearn

* Split the training and testing data roughly 80/20.
* To get the same random split every time you run your notebook use `random_state=10`. This helps us get the same results every time and avoid confusion while we're learning.

The next step is to evaluate our regression. How good our regression is depends not only on the r-squared. It also depends on the **residuals** - the difference between the model's predictions ($\hat y_i$) and the true values ($y_i$) inside `y_train`.

```

residuals = (y_train - predicted_values)

The first plot should be actual values (`y_train`) against the predicted value values:

The cyan line in the middle shows `y_train` against `y_train`. If the predictions had been 100% accurate then all the dots would be on this line. The further away the dots are from the line, the worse the prediction was. That makes the distance to the cyan line, you guessed it, our residuals üòä

"""Why do we want to look at the residuals? We want to check that they look random. Why? The residuals represent the errors of our model. If there's a pattern in our errors, then our model has a systematic bias.

We can analyse the distribution of the residuals. In particular, we're interested in the **skew** and the **mean**.

In an ideal case, what we want is something close to a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a skewness of 0 and a mean of 0. A skew of 0 means that the distribution is symmetrical - the bell curve is not lopsided or biased to one side. Here's what a normal distribution looks like:

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/7QBqDtO.png height=400>

* Calculate the mean and the skewness of the residuals.

* Is the skewness different from zero? If so, by how much?
* Is the mean different from zero?

"""### Data Transformations for a Better Fit

We have two options at this point:

1. Change our model entirely. Perhaps a linear model is not appropriate.
2. Transform our data to make it fit better with our linear model.

Let's try a data transformation approach.

**Challenge**

Investigate if the target `data['PRICE']` could be a suitable candidate for a log transformation.

* Use Seaborn's `.displot()` to show a histogram and KDE of the price data.
* Calculate the skew of that distribution.
* Use [NumPy's `log()` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.log.html) to create a Series that has the log prices
* Plot the log prices using Seaborn's `.displot()` and calculate the skew.
* Which distribution has a skew that's closer to zero?

"""#### How does the log transformation work?

Using a log transformation does not affect every price equally. Large prices are affected more than smaller prices in the dataset. Here's how the prices are "compressed" by the log transformation:
