Dictionary Comprehension 1
You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes
each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.

Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.  *

*Do NOT** Create a dictionary directly.

Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.

To keep this exercise simple, count any punctuation following a word with no whitespace as part of the word.
Note that "Swallow?" therefore has a length of 8.
