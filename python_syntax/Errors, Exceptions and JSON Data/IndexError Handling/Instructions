IndexError Handling
Issue



We've got some buggy code. Try running the code. The code will crash and give you an IndexError.

This is because we're looking through the list of fruits for an index that is out of range.



Objective



Use what you've learnt about exception handling to prevent the program from crashing. If the user enters something that is out of range just print a default output of "Fruit pie".



IMPORTANT: The exception handling should NOT allow each fruit to be printed when there is an exception. e.g. it should not print out Apple pie, Pear pie and Orange pie, when there is an exception it should only print "Fruit pie".
